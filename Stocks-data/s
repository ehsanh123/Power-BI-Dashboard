## 🚀 Project Overview

This dashboard is part of an Agile/CRISP-DM-driven AI project aimed at predicting stock trends using historical prices and alternative data (e.g., sentiment, Google Trends).

This first test includes:
- Baseline model prediction (e.g., Linear Regression or LSTM)
- Visual comparison of actual vs predicted prices
- Initial data pipeline setup
- Simple web interface (e.g., Streamlit or Flask)
