# 📈 Stock Market Prediction Dashboard – First Test

A minimal prototype dashboard for visualizing and testing stock market predictions using machine learning. This version focuses on the core prediction logic, basic visual output, and integration of initial data sources.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This dashboard is part of an Agile/CRISP-DM-driven AI project aimed at predicting stock trends using historical prices and alternative data (e.g., sentiment, Google Trends).

This first test includes:
- Baseline model prediction (e.g., Linear Regression or LSTM)
- Visual comparison of actual vs predicted prices
- Initial data pipeline setup
- Simple web interface (e.g., Streamlit or Flask)

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🧾 Historical stock data (Yahoo Finance API)
- 🧪 First-pass prediction model
- 📊 Time-series visualization (Matplotlib/Plotly)
- 🧮 Error metrics: RMSE, MAE
- 🧰 Modular codebase for future enhancements
